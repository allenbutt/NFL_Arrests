Visualization Project - NFL Fan and Player Arrests

## Background
We have a dataset of the number of fans arrested at each NFL game from 2011 to 2015, and another of the number of NFL players arrested during that same time period. Could the rowdiness of fans be related to the bad behavior of the players on their local teams? How about local crime rates? This project created a variety of visualizations to compare these factors, without going into predictive modeling.

## Goals
1. The data was gathered by the Washington Post but not validated, and for a variety of reasons much of the data is incomplete. The first goal is to reasonably impute missing data in order to keep as much of it as possible for analysis.
2. Data involving NFL player arrests, city crime rates, and stats for each NFL game in the sample, need to be gathered and merged into the dataset.
3. Completed CSV files need to be imported into Tableau and arranged into useful or interesting visualizations.

## Outcome
The final project outcome visualizations and corresponding code can be found on a post on my portfolio site: https://allenbutt.github.io/NFL-Arrests/
